# to clone a project from github
git clone https://github.com/aliakbarRashidi/testgit


# State: when you change a file in this project cloned from github and commit that change
git status
# say you 
# `you are on Branch master`  and `your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit`
# this means that your local master with remote master has 1 commit difference changes


# to update remote branch with current local branch
git push origin master
# then type your username and password of github account and the work is finish
# the origin means remote repo
# the master means branch master of local repo
# to prevent every time typing 'origin master' you can use -u after push


# State: someone changed some file of remote git project to have remote repo on local repo
# you must mix remote code to local code
git pull origin master
