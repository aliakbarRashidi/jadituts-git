# if you have a local repo and yet not pushed to any remote repo
# you must first create repo on remote 
# then add remote repo to local repo's remote list
git remote add origin https://github.com/git-test

#to see know if remote was add successfully
git remote -v


# now you can push and pull 
git push -u origin master

# you can have more than one remote server
# for example you can push local repo either to github and gitlab

#-----------------------------------------------

# conflict
# State: you and your coworker work on same project; your coworker change README.md at line 2 and pushed to master branch of remote repo successfully
# then you change README.md at line 2 by your own and want to push to master branch of remote repo
git push origin master
#you give an error say you `! [rejected] (fetch first)` because of conflict change in same file by 2 person(you and your coworker)
# so type below command to fetch changes already taken on file we want to push and has conflict

git pull
# git try to auto merge if possible and line has no conlict
# if git cannot auto merge then content of conflict files be both of changes either local and remote change that has conflict with each other
# you must open that file with an editor and remove that change you dont want; and then save file and then commit
vim README.md
git commit -m 'message you want'

git status
# say that `your branch is ahead of origin/master by 2 commits`

git push




#-------------
pull = fetch + merge
